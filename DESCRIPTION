Description: It allows for fast reading and processing of genome read and
    annotation files such as gtf/gff/bed/bam. In addition, it also provides
    functions for advanced manipulations such as filling missing intron 
    coordinates, extracting non-overlapping intron coordinates, extracting 
    overlapping genes etc.
